The aim of this project is to enhance simple human resources management system with distinct types of employees, sort them by using DBMS statements. There are different type of classes such as «Employee», «FullTimeEmployee», «PartTimeEmployee» and others. Additionally, interfaces, for example, «IFTERepository» (interface for full time employee repository),  «IPTERepository» (interface for part time employee repository). In the project, abstract class «Employee» has several fields such as employeeid, name, surname, position, age, date of agreement, expire date. It would help to know all detailed information about workers. Moreover, class «FullTimeEmployee» has field «salary» and method «calculatePayment» that will demonstrate the total salary in one year. As well as, the another class «PartTimeEmployee» consists hoursWorked and rate fields, due to these fields, the program will calculate the payment by using multiplication for part time employees.
